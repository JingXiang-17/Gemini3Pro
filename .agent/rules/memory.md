# Persistent Knowledge Base Rules

1.  **Check First**: Before starting any task, ALWAYS read the `knowledge_base.md` file in the project root to understand past errors, successful patterns, and architectural decisions.
2.  **Update After**: After resolving an issue, fixing a bug, or implementing a complex feature, ALWAYS update `knowledge_base.md` with:
    *   **Context**: What was the problem?
    *   **Root Cause**: Why did it happen?
    *   **Solution**: How was it fixed? (Include code snippets if relevant)
    *   **Learnings**: General principles or "gotchas" to avoid in the future.
3.  **Maintain**: Keep the `knowledge_base.md` organized and readable. Group related items together.
