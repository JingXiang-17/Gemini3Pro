**Introduction to project**    
We are planning to build a **fake news detector** app/website that can integrate into various platform such as Whatsapp. The app will take **text/images** as input, using Gemini AI to validate if the input is true/false news, return the validity and point out the false part (if fake news).    
**Techstack structure planning**    
1. Frontend: Flutter (Google Technology)/React Native (we see which is easier)    
2. Backend: Python + FastAPI    
3. AI model: Gemini API (Google AI)    
4. maybe we will use Android Studio as well
